## The repository contains 3 scripts:
### 1. bootstrap.sh (Install docker and  jenkins inside VM).
### 2. script that checks if ncdu is installed. If not, ask the user if he wants to install it.
### 3. script that accepts arguments that check if nginx installed, and if not - installs it.
###     -  Make sure that the service is up and running & starts on boot.
###     -  Accept additional argument - delete that removes the package and clears all leftovers
